                    <h1>My name is Any Elis Medola (anye.)</h1>
                    <p>I'm a frontend developer with almost 5 years of experience.<br><br>
                        I started programming when I was at age 16 at technical course, I choose this area because my
                        family are professionals from different areas of IT, so I grew up surrounded by computers and
                        people from technology since a very young age.<br><br>
                        My first professional experience was at age 18, performing web programming activities with
                        html5, css3, javascript, php and bootstrap. At the age of 20 I was recruited to join the S2 Pets
                        team, where I have remained until September. At S2 I developed professionally and personally
                        with an amazing team that helped me a lot mainly in communication and proactivity, there I work
                        in a startup with agile methodology and I am familiar with sprints and programs like Jira, in
                        addition I had contact with ionic, angular and mobile development. Now, I’m working at
                        AMBISIG(Lisboa-PT), the first project SCOT+ we used ionic with react and now at SIARL we use
                        ReactJs with KendoUI, that’s my first and second international project, wich makes me proud.<br><br>
                        My passion is reading, I'm a big collector of books, I like to watch old TV shows and some of my
                        favorites are Friends, that's 70 show and full house, I also like The Kardashians, as well as
                        marvel and harry potter movies.<br><br>
                        I'm learning my fifth language and currently living in Sicily, Italy.</p>
