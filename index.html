                    <h1>I'm a frontend developer with 6 years of experience.</h1>
                    <p>I chose a career in Information Technology (IT) due to the strong influence of my father and
                        uncle, both of whom are professionals in this field. As I embarked on my journey to obtain an
                        Associate's degree at the age of 16, I quickly fell in love with the world of IT.
                        <br><br>

                        My passion for continuous learning drives me to constantly expand my knowledge and skills, as my
                        main goal is to grow and improve every day. I believe that staying up-to-date with the latest
                        industry trends and technologies is crucial in delivering high-quality results. It was after
                        completing the Success Linkedin course at Cubos Academy that I realized the importance of showcasing my achievements and skills
                        through a portfolio.<br><br>

                        Now, with a strong foundation in TI, practical experience, and a desire to excel, I am excited
                        to present my portfolio, highlighting my expertise, accomplishments, and growth in the field.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of my professional life, I have a strong passion for reading and have amassed an
                        extensive collection of books. I also find enjoyment in watching classic TV shows such as
                        Friends, That '70s Show, and Full House. Additionally, I have an interest in contemporary pop
                        culture, including The Kardashians, as well as movies from the Marvel and Harry Potter
                        franchises.<br><br>

                        Currently based in Sicily, Italy, I am excited about broadening my horizons by learning my fifth
                        language and exploring new opportunities in the dynamic world of frontend development.

                        pursuing my associate's degree. During this time, I gained valuable experience in web
                        development by creating websites for the agency's clients using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and
                        PHP. As a full-stack developer, my responsibilities extended beyond coding. I also managed the
                        server, handled emails, maintained the MySQL database, and provided customer support and
                        training.</p>

                    <p class="slider__txt">At Zum, an agency, I had the opportunity to work on two significant projects:
                        Drograria Santa Marta and DreamStore.<br><br>

                        For the Drograria Santa Marta project, we developed a campaign in partnership with the Federal
                        Lottery of Raffles. I played a key role in creating a website using PHP, which included an
                        administrative area for managing various aspects of the campaign. This involved features such as
                        coupon registration, support for password changes, announcing winners, and describing the
                        campaign details.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I worked on the DreamStore project, an online children's toy store. I contributed
                        to the year-end campaign, really similar with the Drograria Santa Marta project. </p>

                    <h2 class="slider__caption">S2 Pets</h2>
                    <p class="slider__txt">At S2 Pets, I had the opportunity to focus on frontend development. It was a
                        pivotal point in my career where I worked extensively on enhancing an application for pet owners
                        using Ionic with Angular. I collaborated on developing new features, improving the dashboard,
                        and ensuring a seamless user experience.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I took the initiative to design and develop the landing page for the application
                        using Page. This involved creating an engaging and visually appealing interface to attract
                        potential users.<br><br>

                        Working at a startup provided me with valuable exposure to agile methodologies and sprint
                        programs. I actively participated in agile practices and became familiar with using Jira as a
                        project management tool.<br><br>

                        This experience at S2 Pets marked my entry into the startup world and enriched my understanding
                        of frontend development, agile workflows, and the importance of delivering a user-friendly
                        experience.</p>

                    <h2 class="slider__caption">Ambisig</h2>
                    <p class="slider__txt">Ambisig marked the beginning of my professional career and the fulfillment of
                        a long-awaited dream. I was fortunate to secure a ten-month contract where I had the opportunity
                        to work on two significant projects: Scot+ and Siarl.<br><br>

                        Scot+ was a traffic fines application system, developed using React.js. My role involved
                        designing and implementing various features to streamline the fine application process, ensuring
                        efficiency and user-friendliness.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I contributed to the development of Siarl, a coastal resource management system,
                        also built with React.js. Within this project, I collaborated on creating functionalities that
                        enabled effective management and monitoring of coastal resources, aiming for sustainable
                        practices and environmental conservation.<br><br>

                        These experiences at Ambisig allowed me to further enhance my skills in React.js development,
                        while also gaining valuable insights into project management and teamwork. It was truly a
                        stepping stone in my career and a realization of my professional aspirations.</p>
