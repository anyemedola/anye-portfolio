                    <h1>My name is Any Elis Medola (anye.)</h1>
                    <p>I'm a frontend developer with nearly six years of professional experience in the field. I began
                        my programming journey at the age of 16 when I enrolled in a technical course. Growing up in a
                        family of IT professionals, I was surrounded by computers and immersed in technology from a
                        young age, which influenced my decision to pursue a career in this area.<br><br>

                        At the age of 18, I embarked on my first professional endeavor, engaging in web programming
                        activities that involved HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and Bootstrap. This experience laid the
                        foundation for my growth as a developer. Later, at the age of 20, I was fortunate to join the S2
                        Pets team, where I had the privilege of working with an exceptional group of professionals. The
                        collaborative environment fostered my professional and personal development, particularly in
                        terms of communication skills and proactivity. S2 Pets was a startup that adhered to agile
                        methodologies, and I became well-versed in sprint cycles and tools like Jira. During my tenure,
                        I also gained exposure to Ionic, Angular, and mobile development.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I spent ten months working as a contract developer for Ambisig, contributing to
                        two significant projects: SCOT+ and SIARL. These projects involved developing a system for
                        processing traffic tickets and a Coastal Resource Management System, respectively, which aimed
                        to adapt to Coastal Adaptation Strategies in Climate Change Scenarios. In addition to these
                        professional roles, I have also worked as a freelance frontend web and mobile developer at A&A
                        IT, specializing in React Native and ReactJS.<br><br>

                        Outside of my professional life, I have a passion for reading and have built an extensive
                        collection of books. I also enjoy watching classic TV shows such as Friends, That '70s Show, and
                        Full House. Additionally, I have an interest in contemporary pop culture, including The
                        Kardashians, as well as movies from the Marvel and Harry Potter franchises.<br><br>

                        Currently, I am living in Sicily, Italy, and I am thrilled to be expanding my horizons by
                        learning my fifth language.

                        pursuing my associate's degree. During this time, I gained valuable experience in web
                        development by creating websites for the agency's clients using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and
                        PHP. As a full-stack developer, my responsibilities extended beyond coding. I also managed the
                        server, handled emails, maintained the MySQL database, and provided customer support and
                        training.</p>

                    <p class="slider__txt">At Zum, an agency, I had the opportunity to work on two significant projects:
                        Drograria Santa Marta and DreamStore.<br><br>

                        For the Drograria Santa Marta project, we developed a campaign in partnership with the Federal
                        Lottery of Raffles. I played a key role in creating a website using PHP, which included an
                        administrative area for managing various aspects of the campaign. This involved features such as
                        coupon registration, support for password changes, announcing winners, and describing the
                        campaign details.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I worked on the DreamStore project, an online children's toy store. I contributed
                        to the year-end campaign, really similar with the Drograria Santa Marta project. </p>

                    <h2 class="slider__caption">S2 Pets</h2>
                    <p class="slider__txt">At S2 Pets, I had the opportunity to focus on frontend development. It was a
                        pivotal point in my career where I worked extensively on enhancing an application for pet owners
                        using Ionic with Angular. I collaborated on developing new features, improving the dashboard,
                        and ensuring a seamless user experience.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I took the initiative to design and develop the landing page for the application
                        using Page. This involved creating an engaging and visually appealing interface to attract
                        potential users.<br><br>

                        Working at a startup provided me with valuable exposure to agile methodologies and sprint
                        programs. I actively participated in agile practices and became familiar with using Jira as a
                        project management tool.<br><br>

                        This experience at S2 Pets marked my entry into the startup world and enriched my understanding
                        of frontend development, agile workflows, and the importance of delivering a user-friendly
                        experience.</p>

                    <p class="slider__txt">Ambisig marked the beginning of my professional career and the fulfillment of
                        a long-awaited dream. I was fortunate to secure a ten-month contract where I had the opportunity
                        to work on two significant projects: Scot+ and Siarl.<br><br>

                        Scot+ was a traffic fines application system, developed using React.js. My role involved
                        designing and implementing various features to streamline the fine application process, ensuring
                        efficiency and user-friendliness.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I contributed to the development of Siarl, a coastal resource management system,
                        also built with React.js. Within this project, I collaborated on creating functionalities that
                        enabled effective management and monitoring of coastal resources, aiming for sustainable
                        practices and environmental conservation.<br><br>

                        These experiences at Ambisig allowed me to further enhance my skills in React.js development,
                        while also gaining valuable insights into project management and teamwork. It was truly a
                        stepping stone in my career and a realization of my professional aspirations.</p>
