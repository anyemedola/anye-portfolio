                    <h1>My name is Any Elis Medola (anye.)</h1>
                    <p>I'm a frontend developer with almost 6 years of experience.
                        <br><br>
                        I started programming when I was at age 16 at technical course, I choose this area because my
                        family are professionals from different areas of IT, so I grew up surrounded by computers and
                        people from technology since a very young age.
                        <br><br>
                        My first professional experience was at age 18, performing web programming activities with
                        html5, css3, javascript, php and bootstrap. At the age of 20 I was recruited to join the S2 Pets
                        team, where I have remained until September. At S2 I developed professionally and personally
                        with an amazing team that helped me a lot mainly in communication and proactivity, there I work
                        in a startup with agile methodology and I am familiar with sprints and programs like Jira, in
                        addition I had contact with ionic, angular and mobile development. I had a 10 months contract at
                        Ambisig to be part of SCOT+ and SIARL team, a system to apply traffic tickets and Coastal
                        Resource Management System - to adjust to Coastal Adaptation Strategies in Climate Change
                        Scenarios respectively. I also works as a freelancer frontend web and mobile developer at A&A It
                        using react native and reactJS.
                        <br><br>
                        My passion is reading, I'm a big collector of books, I like to watch old TV shows and some of my
                        favorites are Friends, that's 70 show and full house, I also like The Kardashians, as well as
                        marvel and harry potter movies.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm learning my fifth language and currently living in Sicily, Italy.

                        pursuing my associate's degree. During this time, I gained valuable experience in web
                        development by creating websites for the agency's clients using HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and
                        PHP. As a full-stack developer, my responsibilities extended beyond coding. I also managed the
                        server, handled emails, maintained the MySQL database, and provided customer support and
                        training.</p>

                    <p class="slider__txt">At Zum, an agency, I had the opportunity to work on two significant projects:
                        Drograria Santa Marta and DreamStore.<br><br>

                        For the Drograria Santa Marta project, we developed a campaign in partnership with the Federal
                        Lottery of Raffles. I played a key role in creating a website using PHP, which included an
                        administrative area for managing various aspects of the campaign. This involved features such as
                        coupon registration, support for password changes, announcing winners, and describing the
                        campaign details.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I worked on the DreamStore project, an online children's toy store. I contributed
                        to the year-end campaign, really similar with the Drograria Santa Marta project. </p>

                    <h2 class="slider__caption">S2 Pets</h2>
                    <p class="slider__txt">At S2 Pets, I had the opportunity to focus on frontend development. It was a
                        pivotal point in my career where I worked extensively on enhancing an application for pet owners
                        using Ionic with Angular. I collaborated on developing new features, improving the dashboard,
                        and ensuring a seamless user experience.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I took the initiative to design and develop the landing page for the application
                        using Page. This involved creating an engaging and visually appealing interface to attract
                        potential users.<br><br>

                        Working at a startup provided me with valuable exposure to agile methodologies and sprint
                        programs. I actively participated in agile practices and became familiar with using Jira as a
                        project management tool.<br><br>

                        This experience at S2 Pets marked my entry into the startup world and enriched my understanding
                        of frontend development, agile workflows, and the importance of delivering a user-friendly
                        experience.</p>

                    <p class="slider__txt">Ambisig marked the beginning of my professional career and the fulfillment of
                        a long-awaited dream. I was fortunate to secure a ten-month contract where I had the opportunity
                        to work on two significant projects: Scot+ and Siarl.<br><br>

                        Scot+ was a traffic fines application system, developed using React.js. My role involved
                        designing and implementing various features to streamline the fine application process, ensuring
                        efficiency and user-friendliness.<br><br>

                        Additionally, I contributed to the development of Siarl, a coastal resource management system,
                        also built with React.js. Within this project, I collaborated on creating functionalities that
                        enabled effective management and monitoring of coastal resources, aiming for sustainable
                        practices and environmental conservation.<br><br>

                        These experiences at Ambisig allowed me to further enhance my skills in React.js development,
                        while also gaining valuable insights into project management and teamwork. It was truly a
                        stepping stone in my career and a realization of my professional aspirations.</p>
